# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In dbt, the default materialization for a model is a view. This means, when you run
# dbt run or dbt build, all of your models will be built as a view in your data platform.
# The configuration below will override this setting for models in the example folder to
# instead be materialized as tables. Any models you add to the root of the models folder will
# continue to be built as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model files
# using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.
